"""Render every unrolled copy of the credential ladder from `lib_credential_ladder.rungs()`.

GitHub Actions cannot loop `uses:` steps and cannot index `secrets.*` by a computed
name, so the ladder is unrolled text by necessity. That makes it a BUILD-TIME
artifact rather than a hand-maintained one: this script owns the marked regions,
the `gen-credential-ladder` pre-commit hook keeps them current, and
`tests/test_gen_credential_ladder.py` asserts the committed regions round-trip.

The order lives in three regions of .github/workflows/auto-resolve.yaml, so a rung added to
`lib/shared-names.json` reaches every one of them at once.

Run with no argument to write, or `--check` to report drift and write nothing.
