"""The review-findings merge gate, as ONE stateless predicate. A PR is clear to merge when:

  (a) the automated reviewer completed at least one review, AND
  (b) no unresolved reviewer-rooted thread still carries a merge-gating finding, AND
  (c) the merge-delta reviewer has published a verdict for the CURRENT head.

INVARIANT — (c) is what stops a head merging while its merge-resolution deltas are
still unread.

A thread's severity comes from the hidden `<!-- severity: … -->` marker
the reviewer stamps on every finding, with the leading icon as the pre-marker
fallback. config/review-severities.json says which severities gate and which icon
each renders as.

Two modes, one predicate:
  - REPORT_SHA set posts the verdict as a COMMIT STATUS on GATE_CONTEXT and exits 0
    once posted, whatever the verdict;
  - REPORT_SHA unset exits 0 green and 1 on anything else, the merge_group mode.

Env: GH_TOKEN, GH_REPO (owner/name), PR; REPORT_SHA, MERGE_DELTA_VERDICT_IN_HAND optional.
