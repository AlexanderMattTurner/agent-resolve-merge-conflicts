"""Run TLC over every committed TLA+ config and hold each to its declared verdict.

PROBLEM CLASS — a specification whose theorems nothing evaluates, so a model
edit that breaks a proof lands green and is found only when someone runs the
model checker by hand.

This check pins what a module CLAIMS. Half the configs here are existence theorems whose counterexample
trace is the deliverable, so a clean pass is their failure: `\\* EXPECT-EXIT: 12`
says the run must find the violation. TLC exits 0 clean, 12 on a violated
INVARIANT and 13 on a violated PROPERTY.

The expectation lives in the `.cfg` the run reads, not in a table beside it, so
the person adding a config writes it in the one file they are already editing. A
config with no marker is a hard error: a default would let a new theorem join
the suite unchecked.

A clean config also declares the size of the set it explored, as
`\\* EXPECT-DISTINCT: <n>`, so a model edit that silently moves the reachable
set reds here instead of passing.
