"""Fail when a Markdown file links to a repo-relative path that does not exist.

Guards against link rot: a moved or renamed file silently turning a relative
`[text](path)` link in CLAUDE.md / README / SECURITY.md / docs/ into a dead
link. Deliberately network-free — external `http(s)://` / `mailto:` links and
same-page `#anchors` are skipped, so the check never flakes on a down site.

Base resolution mirrors how each file renders: most Markdown resolves relative
to its own directory (GitHub's default). changelog.d/ fragments assemble into
the repo-root CHANGELOG.md, and the .github/ community templates (PR/issue) are
inserted into a PR or issue body, so their links resolve against the root; the
rest of .github/ is ordinary Markdown read where it sits.

Run with no arguments (scans every tracked *.md). Exit 0 when all internal
links resolve, 1 (listing each broken link) otherwise.
