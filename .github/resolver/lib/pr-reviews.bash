# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body that no test runs: it reads the runner's context
#   — GITHUB_*, a job-scoped GH_TOKEN, an actions/ working directory — or provisions the
#   runner itself, so it has no entry point off a runner.
# Contract: sourced into strict-mode (set -euo pipefail) callers; do not re-set shell options.
#
# The PR review read, in ONE place: the GraphQL document and the reviewer filter that together answer "what has the automated reviewer posted on this PR?". INVARIANT: every step that asks that question goes through this helper, so no caller can ship a `reviews(first: 100)` with no cursor — a query that returns the OLDEST 100 reviews and reports a stale state as the live one.
#
# Consumers: review_findings_gate.py, note-skipped-review.sh.

# `$endCursor` and `pageInfo` are what let `gh api graphql --paginate` walk: drop either and gh has no cursor to advance, so it returns page one forever — and page one of `reviews` is the OLDEST page, so an unpaginated query on a long-lived PR reports a superseded review as the current state.

# reviewer_reviews_ndjson <owner> <name> <pr> — every one of the reviewer's REAL reviews as NDJSON objects {state, body, submittedAt, reviewId, reviewedSha}.
#
# Empty-body reviews are excluded HERE, in the one shared read: GitHub synthesizes a body-less COMMENTED review around every standalone review-comment POST, and counting one as a review both spends the one-review-per-PR budget and satisfies the review-findings gate's reviewed-at-all condition vacuously. The real reviewer never posts an empty body.
#
# reviewId is fullDatabaseId AS A STRING ("" when GitHub omits it), not databaseId: review database ids exceed Int32, which GraphQL's Int-typed databaseId errors on.
#
# The caller must EXPORT REVIEWER_LOGIN_BARE: the jq reads it out of `env`, and GraphQL returns an app bot's login WITHOUT the REST `[bot]` suffix.
