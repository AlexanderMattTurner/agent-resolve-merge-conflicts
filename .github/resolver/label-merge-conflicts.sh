# kcov-exclude: a GitHub Actions step body with a behavioral suite: the suite runs the real
#   script as `bash <script>` against stubbed CLIs on PATH, so no run is ever traced.
# Keep the `merge-conflict` label on every open PR whose GitHub-computed
# mergeability is CONFLICTING, and clear it once the PR merges cleanly again.
# Surfacing the transition when it happens, not at merge time, is what keeps a
# resolution small enough to review. API-only: it never pushes to a PR branch.
#
# Scope: with PR_NUMBER set (a PR event) it syncs that one PR; unset (a base
# push / schedule) it scans every open PR — the only full conflict scan there is.
#
# GitHub answers lazily, and both stale answers are handled here. UNKNOWN means
# no verdict yet; the query enqueues one, and a PR still UNKNOWN after
# MAX_PASSES falls to the git-merge-tree probe below (a scan) or is warned
# about (a PR event). The silent one: right after a base push GitHub serves the
# verdict it computed against the OLD base, a confident MERGEABLE for a PR that
# push just broke. Each row names the tip its verdict used, so a push scan reads
# any tip but the base branch's live one as unresolved (STALE_BASE).
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN, REPO; PR_NUMBER scopes to one PR; BASE_SHA (every full scan)
# turns the staleness check on; MAX_PASSES caps passes;
# RETRY_DELAY_SECS the between-pass wait; SWEEP_PR_LIMIT (lib/pr-sweep.bash) the
# full-scan listing; CONSENT_LABELED=true (a consent-label event) dispatches an
# already-labeled conflict, releasing the resolver's consent deferral;
# MERGE_CONFLICT_PROBE overrides the probe path — its own header says why.
