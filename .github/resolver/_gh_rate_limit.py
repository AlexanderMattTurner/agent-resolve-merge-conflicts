"""Whether the GitHub API budget is EXHAUSTED, and when it comes back.

PROBLEM CLASS — a retry loop that treats every failure as a network blip. A
rate-limit 403 is not a blip: the budget refills on a fixed clock, so an
exponential backoff measured in seconds cannot outlast it, and every attempt
spends another request against a budget that is already empty. The auto-resolve
sweep died this way at 02:07 UTC on 2026-08-12 (run 31555882659) — five attempts
over 2/4/8/16s, ~30 seconds against a limit that had ~52 minutes left to run.

This module is the ONE definition of that distinction. It is reachable two ways
so no caller writes a second copy: Python imports :func:`verdict`, and shell
runs this file, which prints the three fixed lines :func:`main` documents. Both
spend the same knob and print the same wording.

``GET /rate_limit`` costs no primary budget — GitHub does not count it against
one — so asking on a failed attempt is nearly free. It is still a REQUEST, which
the burst limiter does count, so a refusal naming that limiter skips the read:
the endpoint reports the primary buckets only and could not explain it anyway.

Standard library only: the jobs that run this check out ``.github/scripts``
sparsely and use the system ``python3``.
