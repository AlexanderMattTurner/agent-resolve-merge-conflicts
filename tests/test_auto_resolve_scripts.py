"""End-to-end behavior tests for the auto-resolve prepare/bundle/land bash scripts.

Each test builds a scratch origin (bare) + work clone, creates a real merge
conflict, and runs the actual `.github/resolver/auto-resolve/*.sh` scripts with
`pnpm` and `gh` replaced by PATH shims. `pnpm resolve-generated` drives
`tests/_scratch_resolve_generated.mjs`, which stands in for the CALLING
repository's derived-file resolver — this repository ships none, and takes the
caller's through `AUTO_RESOLVE_RESOLVER_MJS` / `AUTO_RESOLVE_PRE_PASS`.

The finalize step is split across a job boundary, and the harness mirrors that:
`bundle` runs in the resolve clone with no push credential and writes a real git
bundle into `BUNDLE_DIR`; `land` runs in a SEPARATE clone of the same origin
(the credentialed job's own checkout), fetches the bundle back, re-verifies it
and pushes. Asserted: the $GITHUB_OUTPUT partition, the on-disk resolution, that
a marker-less unmergeable conflict is never silently committed as "ours", and
that the push half reconciles races / refuses a permanently-blocked push.
