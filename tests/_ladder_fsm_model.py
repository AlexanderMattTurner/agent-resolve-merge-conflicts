"""Finite-state model of the auto-resolve credential ladder's retry policy.

The policy it models is `.github/resolver/auto-resolve/_ladder.py`, and
`tests/test_ladder_equivalence.py` proves this walk and `_ladder.evaluate`
agree on every reachable outcome. `tests/_ladder_fsm_tla.py` prints the same
table as `docs/tla/Ladder.tla`, which TLC checks in CI.

PROBLEM CLASS — a retry policy re-derived as a state machine drifts from the
function it models the moment either side changes alone. The exhaustive
comparison against `_ladder.evaluate` is what stops that.

One walk visits rungs 1..7 in order. At each rung the model steps through one
of four outcomes — a real answer (`OK`, always billed, per `_ladder.py`'s "a
genuine 'conflict too hard' run … has a real cost"), a proven zero-billed error
(`ERR_ZERO`), a billed error (`ERR_PAID`), or a wall-clock-only failure
(`ERR_WALL`, which never advances the walk even when the next rung has its own
configured credential) — and `pos` moves to the next rung or to `DONE`.
`pos == "DONE"` is the only terminal marker: a walk that reached a winner or
exhausted its advances has no further transition to take, so "stopped" needs no
separate flag. `configured2`..`configured7` are ordinary state fields, held
fixed by every transition, because this policy has six independent slots.
