"""Behavioral tests for .github/resolver/auto-resolve/self_review.py — the gate
that reads the resolver's own merge commit the way the post-push merge-delta
watchdog will, lets a model correct what it flags, and REFUSES to push what it
cannot get clean.

Contract:
  * clean first read  -> exit 0, the merge commit is untouched;
  * flagged then clean -> exit 0, the fix is amended INTO the merge commit (never
    stacked as a follow-up, which would leave the flagged resolution in history);
  * still flagged after the round cap -> exit non-zero with the findings, so
    finalize takes its human-handoff path instead of pushing;
  * a model run that crashes, writes no verdict, or leaves conflict markers is a
    CANNOT-VERIFY -> non-zero. Never a pass: treating it as "found nothing" would
    push exactly the resolution this gate exists to catch.

Drives the REAL script against a REAL git repository (so the real
remerge-diff-report.py renders a real `--remerge-diff`) with a fake `claude` on
PATH, scripted per round.
