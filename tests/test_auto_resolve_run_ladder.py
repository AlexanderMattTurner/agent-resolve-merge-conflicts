"""The resolve job's credential ladder as the workflow runs it: one loop, real rungs.

# covers: .github/resolver/auto-resolve/run-ladder.py

`tests/test_auto_resolve_ladder.py` pins the policy (`auto-resolve/_ladder.py`) as
pure functions. This file drives the LOOP that walks it — `run-ladder.py`, invoked
as the workflow invokes it: the real script, the system python3, env in, the step's
`$GITHUB_OUTPUT` back out.

Two of the three processes are real. Each rung's DECIDER is the shipped
`claude-run-errored.sh`, reading a real execution log with the real `jq`, so the
outcomes the policy consumes are the ones the runner would produce rather than a
test's belief about them. Only the ATTEMPT is stubbed: the real
`claude-conflict-resolve.sh` installs the pinned Claude CLI and fans the conflicted
files out to paid model runs. The stub records the environment it was handed, which
is where this file's own subject lives: the loop chooses each rung's credential, and
no child may see another rung's.
