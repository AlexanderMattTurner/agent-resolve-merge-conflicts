"""The bundle step's own functions, driven IN THIS INTERPRETER.

`tests/test_auto_resolve_bundle_equivalence.py` and
`.github/resolver/auto-resolve/bundle.test.mjs` both drive the step as a
subprocess, which is the only way to pin its bytes and its git side effects — and
coverage cannot trace into a child interpreter, so neither measures a single
line. This module closes that: it imports the script and calls its functions
directly, so every refusal and every parse rule is both exercised and measured.

The equivalence corpus stays the authority on WHAT the step outputs. These tests
assert the decisions behind those bytes, one branch at a time.
