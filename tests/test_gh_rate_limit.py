"""The rate-limit verdict, and the three retry loops that read it.

`.github/resolver/_gh_rate_limit.py` is the one definition of "the GitHub budget
is exhausted, and here is when it comes back". Three loops spend it — the
auto-resolve `with_retry`, `_pr_sweep.Gh.run`, and `lib-ci-retry.sh` — so the
verdict is driven against a REAL `gh` here, and each loop's use of it through the
loop's own entry point.

The defect these pin is run 31555882659 (2026-08-12 02:07Z): `gh` answered
`API rate limit exceeded for installation (HTTP 403)`, the loop retried it five
times over ~30 seconds against a budget with ~52 minutes left to run, discover
failed, and the resolve and land jobs were skipped — so that sweep resolved
nothing and 8 conflicted PRs kept no attempt mark at their head.
