"""The generated-region pre-pass, driven against a REAL git merge conflict.

Each test below builds a scratch repository, makes two branches rewrite the same
`BEGIN GENERATED` region, and lets `git merge` produce the conflict — so the
markers are the ones git writes rather than ones a fixture typed. The generator
is a real script the pre-pass really runs, in a real interpreter.

The load-bearing assertion is that the resolved region holds a value NEITHER
side had. Both sides derive their region from the files they added, so only a
generator that ran against the MERGED tree can produce the union — a pass that
merely took a side would leave one side's value standing and pass a weaker test.
