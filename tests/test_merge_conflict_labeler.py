""".github/scripts/label-merge-conflicts.sh — the merge-conflict early-warning labeler.

Drives the real script against a stub `gh` on PATH that serves canned
`pr list` JSON (through real jq, so the script's --jq membership logic is
exercised, not re-implemented) and records every mutating call. Covers each
member of the mergeability enum the script branches on — CONFLICTING,
MERGEABLE, UNKNOWN — crossed with the label's presence, asserting the exact
`pr edit` calls made (and, just as load-bearing, NOT made: an already-correct
PR must not be re-edited on every scan).

Non-vacuity (bash has no CI mutation gate): flipping the CONFLICTING guard to
re-add unconditionally, or dropping the remove branch, changes the recorded
call log and goes red here.
