"""In-process unit tests for the conflict-resolution fan-out.

`.github/resolver/auto-resolve/fanout.test.mjs` drives the whole script as a
subprocess against a fake `claude`, and `test_auto_resolve_fanout_equivalence.py`
pins its output bytes. Neither reaches the code as COVERAGE: both run it in a
child interpreter, which the coverage gate cannot trace into. This file imports
the module and calls its functions directly, so the branches those two suites
exercise behaviorally are also measured.

The cases here are the ones the corpus cannot state cheaply — a jq semantic
reproduced one input at a time, and an error path that needs a crafted file.
