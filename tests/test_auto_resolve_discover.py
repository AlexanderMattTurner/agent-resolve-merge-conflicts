""".github/resolver/auto-resolve/discover.py — which PRs the merge-conflict
resolver is allowed to spend a paid model run on.

The real script runs against the real `gh` binary talking to a fake GitHub
(`tests/_fake_github.py`), so the `--json` field set, the request paths and every
reply shape are validated by the CLI itself rather than assumed. What a test
states is PR facts; the GitHub-shaped JSON is the server's to build. Assertions
are on the emitted list, the script's stdout (a PR dropped by a filter has to SAY
so — a silent skip is indistinguishable from a scan that found nothing) and the
operations the server was asked for.

Contract under test:

  * ELIGIBILITY: open, not a WIP draft (a draft on a session branch is a ready PR
    the cap parked, so it stays eligible), same-repo, CONFLICTING, not opted out
    by label, not a dependency bot's, not a stacked child, and inside the
    commit-age window.
  * SETTLING: a PR whose mergeability GitHub has not computed is re-queried
    until it settles; a PR no verdict could make eligible never holds the loop.
  * NODE LIMIT: the open-PR listing stays inside GitHub's node ceiling — asking
    it for `commits` refuses the whole query and blinds every push scan.
  * ONE ATTEMPT PER HEAD: a head the resolver already ran against is skipped
    until the mark's TTL expires or the run that took it hands it back.
  * QUEUED PRs are never emitted, because any push would dequeue them — and an
    errored queue probe fails CLOSED.
