"""A frozen behavioral-equivalence corpus for the auto-resolve DISCOVER step.

`tests/test_auto_resolve_discover.py` states the contract one property at a
time. This file pins the OUTPUT BYTES instead: every scenario below runs the
real command against the fake GitHub and compares the whole result — the stdout
lines, the raw `prs=` value written to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`, the comments posted per
PR, and the exit status — against a committed golden record.

That is what a rewrite of the step in another language has to reproduce. The
command under test lives in ONE place (`DISCOVER_CMD`), so pointing the corpus
at a port is a one-line edit and the golden file stays untouched: a port that
changes a skip message's wording, drops a filter, or re-orders the emitted array
reds here by name. `FakeResolverGitHub.discover` hard-codes the bash invocation,
so this file drives the command itself rather than calling that runner.

The `prs=` value is kept as the RAW string the script wrote. Re-serializing it
through `json.loads`/`json.dumps` would hide exactly the separator and key-order
differences a port is most likely to introduce.

Regenerate after a deliberate behavior change, then verify:

    uv run python -m tests.test_auto_resolve_discover_equivalence --regen
    uv run pytest tests/test_auto_resolve_discover_equivalence.py

The regen is a `__main__` entry point and not a pytest test, for two reasons:
pytest runs this file's tests in parallel, so a comparison sharing the run with
the write would read whichever version of the file it reached first; and a test
that skips itself on every ordinary run reds the skip census.
